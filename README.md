## Setup Linode Server

Moving from Vultr to linode, the github runners were not running properly on vultr ubuntu server.
I was not able to find more info in logs either.

I tested the same setup on linode and it worked fine. I decided to move to linode so that I can deploy website automatically using GitHub actions.

- [x] Spin a linode server
- [x] Transfer the current data from vultr to linode

This can be marked as done.
